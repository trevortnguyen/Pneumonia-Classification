# Assignment 3: Deep Learning Using Keras

In this assignment, we will classify x-ray imaes to detect whether or not a patient has pneuonmia by building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model via the MobileNetV2 model of Keras.

The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia/data) and was initially used in a research paper. There are 3 datasets, split into a training dataset, test dataset, and validation dataset with a total of 5856 images.
